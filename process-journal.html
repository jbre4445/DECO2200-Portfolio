                <p>One of my projects I have worked on in the 2018 year is for my Interaction Design Studio class and is focused on Autonomous Technology and how it can be used in the future as it becomes more immersed in future society. My task was to work on the interaction aspect between autonomous technology and people to create the interface between the two parties.
                The aim of the project was to first either: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Identify a problem scenario where autonomous technology can be implemented</li>
                    <li>Identify a type of autonomous vehicle and find a area where this technology can be used</li>
                  </ul> 
                  <p>
                  From this decision the remaining design project involved working towards and creating a user interface that helps people interact with autonomous technology to solve the problem.
                </p>
                <p> This project was conducted in a team of 3 and was very challenging as it made me think ouside the box whilst, thinking about the design process to try and find an issue and designing a solution for it. Throughout the process I was able to develop my skills as a designer, especially in understanding how to address user needs and evaluate designs with people in order to improve and develop a top quality design.
                  There were many bumps along the design process that required thought and consideration in order to overcome. This design project passed through various stages before the final design each adding to the design and my own skills.

                <p>Working with my group we first started looking at areas where autonomous technology could be implemented and came up with a few examples:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Poverty</li>
                    <li>Weather/farming</li>
                    <li>Drought Assistance</li>
                    <li>Environment</li>
                    <li>Transport</li>
                    <li>Waste Management</li>
                    <li>Shopping</li>
                    <li>Moving House</li>
                  </ul> 
                  <p>Aswell as these areas we also thought about different problems that people and society face:
                   </p> 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Gardening</li>
                    <li>Interior Design</li>
                    <li>Disaster Relief</li>
                    <li>Maintenance</li>
                    <li>Garbage Collection</li>
                    <li>Medical Emergencies</li>
                    <li>Public Transport</li>
                  </ul> 
                  <p>When considering the area or autonomous technology we wanted to work with, it was important to understand the stakeholders in each of these areas. These stakeholders were the people we would be asking to evaulate our designs meaning some context areas were quickly eliminated. As a student with a limited time frame I realised the group had to work in areas that were achievable to design for.
                  <p>As a group we first narrowed the focus of the project on item delivery to people who needed items on the go or that they had forgotten. This satified the idea of solving a problem using autonomous technology.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  After further discussion my group decided to shift focus to the home as an area for future autonomous technology integration as we felt it had wider space for design concepts and research.
                </p> 
                
<p>The first assignment in this project was based on researching into a specific problem or context. We aimed to research different aspects of the home environment to seek out a common problem that could become our focus for the rest of the project.
                </p>

                <p> My research context involved focusing on the pain points and inefficiencies in the home by addressing 5 key questions:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>1. Where are stress points commonly located in the home environment?</li>
                    <li>2. Are inefficiencies common to certain living situations?
                    </li>
                    <li>3. What are users current processes to overcome pain points? Are they useful?
                    </li>
                    <li>4. Is there situations where autonomous technology can be utilized in home life
                    </li>
                    <li>5. What are the current user attitudes towards autonomous technology advancements?
                    
                    </li>
                    
                  </ul> 

                  <p> This stage in the project challenged me to use different research methods to find insights.

            <p> As we began moving forward with our problem in order to create concepts, my group and I realised we had to change our context area. If we were going to design a system inside the house, it would not satisfy the brief of the project, which was to implement an autonomous vehicle. The system we would use was not a vehicle. We decided a way of changing our context area but still be able to use our research, was to move from inside the home to outside, and more specifically the process of moving house. This led to the creation of a new problem statement:

                <p>This period in the design process was a major challenge, since as a group we had worked extensively on the previous context area. As a designer I learnt that ideas and processes can sometimes be incorrect and require quick fixes or redesigns. This was my first experience of a major idea change in a project timeline. I had never had to make such a large change before, however this was an important experience and necessary for a better outcome in the next stages of the project.</p>

                <p>As group moving forward we each came up with a new set of problems and user needs that a moving house design concept had to solve. We then each came up with 3 concepts that would solve these issues. </p>
                <p>My idea was a removalist system that allowed users, who have limited spare time to pack and unpack, to move their belongings over multiple days, whilst prioritising what the user most requires on each day to have their house set up in a livable condition. The system also has a feature that allows the user to transport extra items to their new home, that the system did not prioritize on each day but the user has a preference for and has extra time to facilitate for.
                </p>
                <p>To design, evaluation and iterate this design, I went through a number of stages:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li> 1. I designed a story board of a users hypothetical journey using my design.

                  </li>
                  <li> 2. I sketched out the first iteration of screens.

                  </li>
                  <li> 3. I then evaluated the design with users by asking them to move through the screens and observed their interactions and frustrations.

                  </li>
                  <li> 4. I created a second iteration based on feedback and then evaluated the new design a second time.

                  <p>Throughout this process I was able to learn about the importance of working with a design through the stages of iteration and evaluation. The evaluation sessions I found were extremely important in understanding how I could improve my concept and better address user needs. I also realised how easy it was at times to design something that I liked without thinking about the users.</p>

                <p>As the project began to transition into the final stages of the design process, my group and I began transitioning screens from low to high fidelity. This meant using sketch to create black and white frames that could be put in InVision to give users a better feeling of the flow of the concept in evaluation sessions. The first iteration was received poorly as the screens were complicated and and users could not differentiate between what was interactive and what was not. </p>
                <p>The second iteration was a cleaner design to help with user flow. There was a consistent tone across the screens. The functionality was similar to the first iteration. In a second set of evaluations, users were less hesitant and features were added to help with error recovery which users noticed and took advantage of. Some parts of the design did feel unnecessary such as weather features.
                </p>
                <p>The final design had colour introduced to give the design a finished look. The user flow remained the same.


                </p>
                <p> After each design, user evaluation was conducted providing important feedback. Since each of the wireframes were created with sketch they could be placed in InVision and tested as a real app. I found it very useful to use InVision as a prototyping tool.

                  <p>Throughout the course of this design project I was able to deepen my understanding of the stages in the design process. It was clearly evident if steps weren't taken the project would not work and the finished design would not be successful. Moving forward in my course I will be able to take what I have learnt during this project and apply it to future projects. I especially understand the importance of the iteration and evaluation stage in the design process and felt by conducting an extensive attempt at this stage, the overall design was more successful.</p>
